## Dataset Overview

I was provided with one dataset with two sheets.

offence table: the column names are offence by category, offence by subcategory, and numbers of crime.
offence dim table: the column names are state and region.
Data Analysis

I analyzed the already-cleaned data to answer the following questions.

Generally, the southwest has the highest number of crimes against people, Lagos took the lead and it’s understandable because of the highest population density in such a small landmass and the inflow of all kinds of people from other regions,

## ASSAULT

Southwest took the lead in that region Lagos has the highest by Count and this is agreeable we can see thugs attacking people in traffic, laying siege for those coming from work in dark spots, especially phone snatching and robbery.

South-east came second in the region category and Abia has the highest by count. This was due to the activities of IPOB at the highest in 2017 and the kidnapping that started in that region.

Kano has the Highest in the Northwest but the count in this region is low compared to other regions.

## GRIEVOUS HARM WOUNDING

Southwest also took the lead in the regional segment while Lagos leads and it’s obvious, this is an almost everyday occurrence in Lagos.

## UNNATURAL OFFENCE

Firstly, an unnatural offense is an offense committed against a person but would not lead to injury or loss of life such as same-sex intercourse, intercourse with an animal, etc.
This kind of offense is prominent in the Northwest, where Kano took the lead followed by the Southeast where Abia took the lead.

## RAPE

Southwest took the lead followed by Northwest. in the southwest Lagos top the list while Kano in the northwest

## ATTEMPTED SUICIDE

This got me I wasn’t expecting Ekiti to lead among the state in the southwest region ..attempted divide is more prominent in the southwest compared to other regions of Nigeria.

## MAN’S SLAUGHTER

Northeast took the lead of course Borno state was at the center of this due to the onslaught of Boko haram and other militia groups followed by southeast and south-south.

## CHILD STEALING

South-south took the lead and Akwa Ibom top the least for the first time in all the crime committed in that region Southwest came second followed by the southeast and as expected Abia top the list of states in the southeast.

## RECOMMENDATION

A city like Lagos should be a city like London the city with the highest number of cameras Lagos state needs such infrastructures because many of these offences in Lagos are committed on the road, mostly in open spaces.

Even though you can’t control the inflow of people into Lagos state but we can put measures in place on every street to capture events at odd times.
